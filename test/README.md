## tests

There are a handful of examples showing how `blott` may be used.

 - `const-nat.blott` - The proof that `nat` is constant.
 - `s4.blott` - The proofs that `[box A]` satisfies the S4/comonad rules.
 - `boxed-eq.blott` - A small example with intesional identity types and `[box A]`.
 - `eq.blott` - A demonstration of the syntax and use of intesional identity types.
 - `fib.blott` - A demonstration of natural numbers in `blott` by computing Fibonnacci numbers.
 - `id.blott` - A small example of how eta-expansion works in blott.
 - `not-expand.blott` - The example from the paper where eta *contraction* is invalid.
 - `top-level-constant.blott` - A demonstration of a simple convenience: all top-level definitions are constant.
 - `top-level-transparent.blott` - A demonstration that the silent unfolding of definitions works.
