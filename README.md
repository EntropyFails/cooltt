## nbe-for-mltt

An implementation of Normalization by Evaluation for Martin-LÃ¶f Type
Theory with dependent products (pi), dependent sums (sigma),
natural numbers, and a cumulative hierarchy.

This implementation correctly handles eta for both pi and sigma.

It is heavily based on the description provided in "Normalization by
Evaluation Dependent Types and Impredicativity" by Andreas Abel.
